# Course Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data
This repository contains the required code for the course assignment of  Module 3: Getting and Cleaning Data of the Data Science specialization course.

The code generates tidy data as required by the assigment.  As long as the Samsung data is in the working directory, the code when run performs the following actions:

1. Combines the training and test data into a single dataset
2. Extracts the fields that relate to the mean and standard deviation measures only
3. Renames the headings to allow for detailed descriptions
4. Calculates the average of each field, by each of the 30 subjects, and each of the 6 activities.

The output will be a text file containing the tidy dataset, saved in the working directory.
